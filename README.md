## Description 📝

The "mysite-django" is a blog where you can include, edit, and delete posts through Django admin. Additionally, you can view a list of all posts and the details of each post in a view stylized with HTML and CSS in your browser.

## Usage 🕹️

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Access the Django project in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.
2. The project uses a virtual environment, so it is necessary to create and activate it before installing the project's dependencies. This can be done with the following commands:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. The project uses Django's default database, SQLite. Therefore, it is necessary to initialize it.
